Django/Python app on GoogleAppEngine
======

Welcome!

This is a sister module to the Pluralsight lesson: [Django Fundamentals with Reindert-Jan Ekker](http://bit.ly/QUWVkU). This repo comes with a corresponding set of videos that can be found [here](http://bit.ly/1jzMJGa).

This module was created for UVU students in CS 4690, but is open to all, as is the video playlist.
